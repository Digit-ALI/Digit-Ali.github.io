Data Dreams of Decolonization: My Intra-American Slave Trade Dataset Experience

The intra-American dataset reveals a wealth of data collected for over thirty years of research. The most significant aspect about reading the data is that it demonstrates the nonlinear trajectory of the slave trade and offers numerous possibilities although it appears neat and clean. We tend to think of slave trade histories as if they were perfectly planned, voyages went smoothly, and European colonizers effortlessly brought and traded enslaved Africans in the New World. As I worked with the dataset, I noticed the uncertainty of categories and the nuance behind what was recorded¬¬––chaos. While this data is useful for historians it is not comprehensive and requires critical investigation of primary sources: ledgers, account books, and ship captain’s journals. However, these are colonial records and must be read against like some of readings from this semester have suggested. “When approaching any new source of knowledge, whether it be a dataset or dinner menu …it’s essential to ask questions about the social, cultural, historical, institutional, and material conditions under which that knowledge was produced, as well as about the identities of the people who created it” (Data Feminism, 153). Thus, the production of knowledge and colonial logic must remain present when exploring slave-trade data.

	This dataset is imperative to American, Caribbean, and Latin American scholars of economic slave histories. The categories, such as ship departure, vessel names, principal places of landing and purchase, provides a sense of regionality and who was involved. From this point one can begin to ask big questions: Why did the Vessel named the Raven initiate its voyage in New York take slaves from upper Atlantic to Rio de Jeneiro? When we know that many times Vessels transferred in the Caribbean, were there other products on the ship? Was there a special reason to make a longer voyage? While there could be no specific reason, or one is speculating about certain voyages, these questions can be the starting points for new data or research into the field. 
  
	Scholars, teachers and those interested in this intra-America data can gain an understanding of the logic of the slave trade–– was it in ship captains’ interest to make longer trips? Why did they continue to make so many voyages when in some accounts nearly the whole ship was lost? What drove their desperation? This data displays a wealth of information but what is of critical importance specifically for scholars is what is missing––the silence in the records. It was interesting to see the total embarked, disembarked, slaves died and mortality rate. I wanted to know who counted? Where infants and refuse slaves counted in mortality rate? (Refuse slaves where those were disabled, sick, or diseased and would most likely die. Jennifer Morgan and Marisa Fuentas discuss this concept in their monographs). My experience with this data revealed a peculiar sentiment, for everything I saw in data there was a silence that followed. As scholars we must be cautious that while this data is needed, takes an incredible amount of work to collect and maintain, it is not comprehensive of the enslaved experience. Historiographically, slave trade histories have been siloed into economic history, providing percentages for the number of voyages, enslaved people embarked, disembarked and those who died. These monographs tend to take the social scientist approach that leaves the socio-cultural side marginalized. After exploring this dataset, I saw that a deeper read and questioning of the data can help to relieve some of the silence. 
  
	In Roopkia Risam’s New Digital Worlds she discusses the cautions scholars must take in creating and using data to tell stories about oppressed and enslaved people, because data too can host colonial perspectives. “In the context of the digital cultural record, digital archives hold both the risk of reaffirming colonial discourse and the promise of challenging it through the development of new archives and design practices.” (Risam, 47) This interested me because my research focuses on the social and cultural aspects of the black American experience. Without thinking critically and questioning, how your sources came into existence, who it was recorded by, why it was recorded, and how did the person recording understand the subject being observed? One could fall to the same colonial perspectives that many scholars are pushing against. For example, in the intra-American slave trade data set I noticed that there were unfilled categories when I downloaded the entire set. These were categories such as boys, girls, and women, but how would colonial officials categorize or understand enslaved Africans by age? They couldn’t understand the African dialects. Was male and female lumped together in and separated by sex? Many times, colonials didn’t bother recording the sex, but thinking through how they may have thought of gender is pertinent to decolonizing the (digital) archives. 
  
	Specific categories of gender and sex is a pitfall of this data, but it is almost never recorded in primary source documents. There are few methods that work to alleviate this silence, such as a reading against ship captain journals. Sometimes these journals reveal rebellions where they talk about the overwhelming and “rowdy” female captives. Historian Jennifer Morgan and Marisa Fuentas demonstrate this in their works on the female bodies in slave histories. It is because of the data now available to us that those scholars can now see that many of the slave ships carried more female slaves than male. Using both the digital in tandem with social and cultural methodologies allows for a richer understanding of the slave trade. This experience and the readings from class have inspired me to put forth a serious effort into working with my own dataset in the future and creating my own project. My data will dream of decolonization by using the information that is available and using a serious combination post-colonial theory and social methods to fill in the gaps. While one can only speculate on silences, it does not mean that we cannot propose multiple answers and questions for the silence.
  
	The researchers, collaborators and scholars behind the intra-American slave trade are aware of this project not being a precise and accurate representation of voyages and slave trade experience. But they have created a foundation on which future scholars can build and begin to interrogate the silences. On the about page of the website they state that “this data is part of a great surge of information on the slave trade that has happened since 1999. Latin-American slaving expeditions were seriously under-represented on the CD-ROM, and, as a consequence, between 2001 and 2005 a major research initiative was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish language archives around the Atlantic basins to address this deficiency.” The continued work of scholars and those interested in the project has continued to fill in the data gaps and maintain the importance of this work.
