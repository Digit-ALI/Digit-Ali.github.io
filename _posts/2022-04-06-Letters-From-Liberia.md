Letters from Liberia: Black Colonization in the Early 19th Century

This dataset, Letters from Liberia contains a vast number of letters from African Americans who settled in Liberia from 1833-1869. A reflection of the colonization movement in the antebellum era, African Americans addressed letters to family, previous enslavers and formed business connection through these correspondences. While this dataset will only contain letters coming from Liberia, there are correspondences from the United States that are not included because they have not been located. There were thousands of African American migrants that settled in Liberia, all of them did not write, but the few letters collected demonstrate a transatlantic network and life after enslavement.

This data comes from a collection of published primary sources, Slaves No More: Letters from Liberia 1833-1869 by Bell Wiley. This work is in no way comprehensive of the lives and experiences of African Americans but is a sizable collection that provides detailed insight into the colonization movement. While these letters are one-way correspondences from Liberia to America, they allude to the multiple conversations that were held on both side of the Atlantic. This dataset will begin with the collection from this source and will be added to over time.

The preliminary metadata fields are:

Date (Written)	Date (Postal stamped) 	Sender	Receiver	City/Town in Liberia 	United States City and State	Relationship	Principle Interest	Family Affiliation	Plantation if applicable

The audience for my data set are first and foremost scholars in the field of American nineteenth century history, however, I want this data to be accessible to anyone with an interest in learning about American history. Therefore, it will need to include fields, such as, principle state of interest in the letters to quickly identify those conducting business, writing family members, or addressing complaints in the colony. The field “family affiliation” will help to draw connections to surnames, and perhaps provide sense of network or kinship ties across the Atlantic. Another field I will include is the number of letters from a specific individual. These fields are specifically for scholars because they will help to locate quickly how some of the connections are made, what groups of letters belong with one another, and some of the silences overlooked in scholarship (i.e., families sometimes write separate letters to the same person, also family members were constantly arriving in the colony and this dataset could help to illuminate those connections). However, I want to present this data in a clear manner that is easily readable by a lay audience.

There are a few questions I hope this dataset helps to answer in terms of the Black colonization movement. 
1.	How many people wrote from Liberia to the United States? (Based on what’s collected)
2.	What were some of their interests?
3.	What were some of their familial connections in America?
4.	How many wrote to previous enslavers?
5.	How consistent was their writing over a given period?
6.	Do the letters specify their connection to a plantation or city?
7.	Were they previously enslaved or were free even before migrating to Liberia?

These are two examples of datasets in the field of American history out of the Journal of Slavery and Data preservation. While these datasets represent the data collected on numerous topics, such as Free blacks in New Orleans and Georgia. My data set will help to look at the transnational afterlife of slavery in Liberia. There is currently no dataset that looks at free blacks leaving the United States and being expatriated to the African colony of Liberia. The history that I am working on is a short fleeting moment within the antebellum era and does not hold a prominent scholarship like other American history areas (Civil War). Thus, much work has not been done in this area. My data set can offer new perspectives on nineteenth century colonization not only because it is novel but also because scholars and American history at large does not view a “return migration” as pertinent to American imperialism or even slavery. 

I am interested in creating this dataset to locate a nexus of networks within the Atlantic basin. When African Americans left the plantations, cities, and towns of the United States they held on to their kinship ties, familial bonds, and connections to America. This dataset aims to fill in silences and gaps in American scholarship on colonization by highlighting the interest of letters and concerns blacks held for their new home in Liberia. Many other datasets hinge on the experience of blacks, both enslaved and free within the United States, but what of their transnational movement? The slave trade data bases highlight the movement from Africa, and how Africans were subjected to colonial powers, but what of the reverse movement from American “back to Africa,” and how blacks claimed freedom, liberty within another moment, albeit ephemeral? Thus, my contribution to American history and the digital humanities is embedded within my work on this project.
