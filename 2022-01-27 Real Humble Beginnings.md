Description of Lab 1: Lab 1 was a creation of our own websites and repositories on Github.com. This involved me learning some basic steps for creatinf a website like selecting a theme, forking my repository to Github, and understanding the main branch and some of its components. Here in the interface I was able to change titles under _ Config.yml. This really put into persective the plaint text or html beihnd the everyday web pages that we visit. I think this was the most empowering part of the lesson, while I am new to learning coding and DH studies, being able to make something feels great. What is also amazing about working in the repository is that you can clearly see your progess, edits, and errors. I think keeping track of those things effortlessly is great for reflection and seeing how you learn. As I progress through the labs I think it will be very helpful to learn the proper vocabulary for things are and mean. Nothing was diffcult per se, however, I was getting an error message and It was due to my title being read wrong, so I inserted double quotes to fix the issue. 

The discussed readings this week challenged my thinking about the intersections of digital humanities and historical scholarship by examining whats "data" is, and it's evolution over the past centuries.
